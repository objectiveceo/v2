Welcome to [Objective CEO]!

# About the name
I've been a lifelong Mac user.  While my career has allowed me to dabble in Windows and Linux development (including web, mobile, and desktop applications), my preferred primary computing device has always been a Mac.  When I started my career, I learned some C, a little C++, and some BASIC (much love for REALbasic).  However, the first programming language that I truly learned to love and appreciate was Objective-C, which was the primary programming language for macOS until Swift came along.

The choice of &quot;[Objective CEO]&quot; is direct reference to Objective-C.  I continue to have a strong fondness for the language.  The use of square bracing directly references its characteristic mechanics.

# About this blog

As far as it goes, I won't actually provide any business or executive advice.  The &quot;CEO&quot; part is merely there as a play on Objective-C.  My intention is merely to have an outlet for my internal thoughts.  Writing is a wonderful skill to have and hone, so this blog is my effort to practice.
I have three other blogs in mind that shape what I hope this grows into:

* [Michael Tsai's blog](https://mjtsai.com/blog/) is a wonderful summation of a lot of technical writing.  I really appreciate this format for a link blog.
* I always love the deep, multi-post journeys from [Fabulous Adventures in Coding](https://ericlippert.com).  I don't think that I want to on 30+ part adventures in this blog, but I do want to try to capture some of the thoroughness that Lippert puts in.
* Finally, I learned a lot of how to be a manager from Lopp's [Rands in Respose](https://randsinrepose.com).  I'd like to explore the business of developing software and teams out loud.

# About the software

I'm open sourcing the software that I've written to maintain this blog.  There's no real goal towards it other than to give me a creative outlet to put code and test ideas.  I have some ideas on side projects and other items that I might explore that may be associated with this website.  To that extent, I'm creating a bespoke website authoring tool that gives me a lot of flexibility.  I'll likely write more about the whats and whys in the future of the blog.

# About me

I am a straight, white, cisgender male in the middle of his career.  I have been progamming calculators and computers since before the millenium and working in and around the software development field since 2002.  I've worked in many areas of the industry.  I've written software for most major desktop OSes (macOS, Windows, and Linux), some of which even had a GUI.  I've authored and deployed software for iOS and Android.  I also have spent a decent amount of time implementing and maintaining internet-based services.  I still consider myself to be a programmer at heart, but I mainly work in staff and product management roles lately.

Like this blog, I'm a work in progress.  I look forward to the task of organizing my thoughts and I look forward to any conversation and growth that it spurs.
