--------------------------------------------------------------

My child is celebrating a birthday on Monday.  My spouse and I decided to throw a party yesterday.  Saturday was just a more convenient day for us and our Zoom guests.  One of my duties was to source a birthday cake.  I knew exactly what my parameters were: chocolate frosting and super heroes.

I still messed it up, but everything went so much better for it.

# The Cake as a Metaphor for Agile Practices

I knew everything that I needed to know in order to make this birthday cake.  I knew how to bake.  I knew how to decorate.  I knew what flavors to use.  This should have been a shoe-in.  But I did not do the most important thing: verify with my client.

As it went down, I put my child to bed on Friday night and then got busy decorating the cake.  I had already baked off a layer cake and let it cool.  I made the frosting and then got started on the decorating.  I used marshmallow-rice treats as a basic molding material and wrapped colored fondant around to make approximations of super hero masks, medallions, and features to put on top of the cake.  I then put the cake away and went on with my evening.

In the morning, I revealed my work to the birthday celebrant.  It was not correct.  There were supposed to be *miniature* superhero figures on the sides of the cake.  The representation was all wrong.

In this moment, I re-learned a lesson that I have to re-learn from time to time: **Solicit direct feedback from your primary stakeholder while you are in the process of creation.**

I could have begun a portion of the decorating with my child prior to bedtime.  I could also have discussed the plans with the cake a prop that we could use to collaboratively envision what it would look like.  I didn't.  And now I have a problem.

## The Process is the Point

This problem isn't terribly dire.  But the disappointment of a soon-to-be-five-year-old can be crushing.  Not to mention the fact that I already know that my very stubborn child may be put off from the cake and decide to be unhappy during his party.  Again, not the end of the world, but I have an opportunity to avoid this malady.

I just made a cake.  I know that I have enough ingredients to make another cake.  I don't have enough fondant to remake a lot of figures, but I do have enought to make at least one.  I also know that I can invite my child to make the cake and invest in it with me.  I can also predict when I'll be going grocery shopping again and know I can replace or stock up on any items that we're running low on.

I'm not thrilled to be making another cake, but I've made enough that the process isn't onerous.  I do get to spend quality time with my child and am pleased to be both assistant and instructor.  We eventually have a pretty ugly cake, but it's one that we're both very proud of.

## "Nailed It"

In the end, the birthday party went off without a hitch and we had a cake that we were all delighted by, even if my child said that it looked like something you'd see on *[Nailed It!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nailed_It!)*.  That was perfect.  My spouse laughed; the guests laughed; my child laughed.  I was proud, not only that my child made a birthday cake but also in having enough humility to appreciate it.

Pride in a work doesn't come from perfection.  It comes from investment.  It comes from putting in the energy and seeing the results.  My pride took a hit when my cake wasn't up to snuff.  But I got it all back and then some when we could share in the process and in the product.

I might have been able to make a passable cake if I had learned up front what the actual requirements were.  But it'd be *my* cake.  By sharing the process, it became *our* cake.  Every so often, I need to be reminded that my best work comes from making an imperfect "our" thing rather than the best possible "my" thing.

Now I have a different problem: I have two cakes.  It's not like our Zoom guests could take any home with them.
