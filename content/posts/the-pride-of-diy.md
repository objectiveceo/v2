summary: |
  I took a little PTO in order to build something for myself.  I'm so much
  more pleased with the result because I did it myself.

As mentioned previously, one of my [hobbies is powerlifting][1].  I have worked
out of gyms, but have spent the last two years working out of a home gym.  I
made the decision back in 2020 in order to support my own laziness (I didn't
want to go to a gym after returning from work) but it felt prescient in 2021.

One thing that I've lacked is a proper *space* for powerlifting.  I have a
power rack, which demarks a space for lifting.  What that rack is, there is
where the powerlifting happens.  However, it was just sitting in the garage.
It was fine, but it lacked a sense of permance.  It was just *there*.

The other issue that I was facing was that I was becoming concerned with the
weight that I was using.  I didn't want to drop a weight and crack the concrete
floor.  I was also feeling a littled rattled when setting down heavy deadlifts.
Concrete isn't a forgiving surface, after all.

As such, I decided to build my own powerlifting platform.  I watched some
[YouTube videos][thralls] and decided it was something that was well within
my meager woodworking skills.  I'll leave some photos of my progress, but
I won't bother leaving the steps.  You can find better info online or read the
[guide that I used][diy] if you're curious.

## Happy with the results

[Equivalent commercial platforms][rogue] are quite costly in comparison. Often,
the base cost doesn't include the flooring or requires additional expenditure.
While I'm happy to save some money (mine came in quite cheap in comparison), my
bigger pride is with having built it myself.

There's a certain pride that comes from building something for yourself.  It
never quite goes away.  Every time that I walk up to the platform, I know that
I'm stepping on something that I built with my own hands.  My garage now has a
pleasing wood smell.  I also have a more permanent space for my hobby.

In the end, building was much better than buying.  I wouldn't have the pride of
ownership merely from buying one.  A commercial one might look nicer, but my
relationship with it would be very different.  This is *mine*.

## Know when to build and when to buy

Building something usually takes time.  Buying is often a better option,
especially if what you're buying requires expertise or comes at a high time
cost.  In the case of my powerlifting platform, neither was required.  It made
sense to put in the time and energy to build it.

For today's software developers, there is an almost "never build" attitude.
Anything that can be built will be.  There are even those that argue that you
should only ever build what cannot be bought.  Otherwise, you should always
buy your software.  In most cases, this means outsourcing a lot of the moving
parts of your software to third party libraries.

In many cases, this results in brittle software, vulnerability to all kinds of
security vulnerabilities that originate elsewhere, and a significant waste of
system resources from unused corners of these libraries.  I've seen a lot of
software that takes in a large dependency but only uses a portion of it.  I've
also worked on teams that found significant increases in performance metrics
when we rewrote some items that met our requirements rather than stretch the
code to meet the library's expectations.

I'm not saying that one should never take third party dependencies.  Indeed,
they are great ways to rapidly start a project.  However, the knee-jerk
approach to check NPM for a package rather than research a domain space can
lead to a culture of non-ownership.  The ultimate software is just a series of
transformations between libraries rather than a considered and well-designed
codebase.

Not every part of a codebase will be as fulfilling as I feel about my lifting
platform, but I love it in its imperfection.  I've worked in a lot of imperfect
codebases that I loved.  Part of that love was because of how much of the code
was "mine" (or my team's).  I've also worked in a lot of "clean" codebases
were uninteresting because everything was delegated to another library.  I've
worked in codebases where the profiler highlighted third party libraries
consistently.

These aren't bad things in an of themselves.  The software
existed and provided value.  But there was a significant morale deficit among
the staff that worked on them.  You can build a lot of pride of ownership by
choosing what parts to build and what parts to buy.  With this in mind, you can
make deliberate choices that allow your staff to buy in to the project and
deliver long term results.

Pick the things that need to be bought.  I could have made a squat rack, but
purchasing was the right move there.  I could have purchased a platform, but
building it was the right move there.  Be deliberate in your choices.  You
don't need to "buy" everything.  You also don't need to "build" everything.
But choosing whether to build or buy can create ownership and buy-in from
your staff.  Choose appropriately.
