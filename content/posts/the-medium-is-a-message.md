  The means that you use to communicate with your team may convey more than you intend.

One of the primary pillars of my approach to communication is the realization that what I say isn't what is heard.  There is an entire matrix of elements that goes into how our words, both spoken and written, are received.  One of these elements is what we choose to express ourselves.  That can send unanticipated messages.

The things that we say are, in some ways, shaped by what we use to convey them.  We have a choice of how to express ourselves.  Do we write up a document and then share it with the team?  Do we speak at a formal meeting or maybe make a quip during a standup?  Do we send an email?  Are we expressing ourselves in a Slack message?  Maybe we communicate using a combination of these items or in other ways.

My point is to illustrate that we have multiple mediums for expression.  Each of them carry with them some measure of expectation.  We express very different intentions using formal messaging tools (like meetings or documents) compared to the more information ones (like Slack messaging or quick comments in regular rituals).

The message can be verbal or written.  It can be shared individually or as a group.  It can feel ephemeral or permanent.  Your choice of venue carries a signal of its own.  You have a responsibility to consider the appropriate vessel when communicating with your team.

There are many other facets that may affect how your team receives what it is that you are telling them.  The form is merely one of them.  You be sure that you use the appropriate form at the appropriate time so that the risk of misunderstanding is low.

If something is serious or necessary, then using a more formal means of communication is appropriate.  Write a document, share it, and call a meeting to discuss it.  If you wanted to convey something more trivial, then a Slack (or other constant communication tool) message may be more appropriate.

Whever you do, don't be surprised if the team doesn't respond in the way that you intended if the medium doesn't match the message.  You can control that aspect and should make a deliberate decision to choose the appropriate one.
