summary: |
  Leading teams requires thinking at different scales of time.  Here are a few
  of the common periods and tasks involved at each stage.
---
One of the hardest things about bring in project leadership is figuring out how
and when to make adjustments.  There are a lot of decisions that have an
immediate impact and other decisions that have delayed results.  There are some
things that can be worked on in a "now" timeframe and yet others that we require
some other work to build up to.  Each phase of technical leadership requires
planning in increasing scales of time and being comfortable with increasing
amounts of ambiguity.

* *Individual Contributor*
	
	An individual contributor has the most immediate frame for decision making
	and the lowest amount of ambiguity.  Ideally, the IC is focused on the task
	immediately in front of them.  Decisions should be actionable within a span
	of hours.

* *Tech Lead/Architect*

	Local technical leadership should have a view of the codebase that spans
	beyond the tickets that are on the board.  They should be thinking several
	days or even weeks into the future.  Ambiguity and risk is relatively low,
	though.  These individuals may be running just ahead of the ICs in terms of
	making sure that the codebase is prepared for the next tasks.

* *Team Lead/Scrum Master*

	The titles for this phase is a little fuzzier and might be rolled up into
	titles above or below instead of existing independently.  At this level,
	the product timeline is being immediately reviewed.  Decisions are made in
	the timeline of sprints.  As such, this individual is making plans in the 
	timeframe of multiples of weeks and up to a month or two.  Risk is common
	as confidence in the plan will rapidly decline the further out from "now."

* *Engineering Manager*

	For many, the direct manager may fill the roles of some above titles as
	well.  For our purposes, though, I want to illustrate that someone needs to
	be thinking out beyond the scope of the next few sprints.  Someone needs to
	have a roadmap for the product at a reasonably actionable scale.  This
	person might formally be a "product owner" or "project manager," but the
	manager that oversees career growth and opportunities should also be
	thinking at this scale.  Plans are likely make in terms of quarters rather
	than weeks.  Expect this role to have to think through things in a middle 
	term and working to mitigate scenarios or classes of risks rather than a 
	specific concern.

* *Director*

	Here, I'm assuming that a Director position involves managing multiple
	teams, with managers in place to handle the most immediate conversations
	with staff and product owners.  The Director's job is to help the managers
	execute in the middle term plans and think through larger growth
	initiatives.  There is comparatively little confidence in direct execution 
	at this stage.  This might sound concerning, but there's a lot of risk in
	making concrete plans on the scale of half-years and years.  The Director's
	role is to set a vision on the horizon and enable the staff to bring it in.
	That vision should be reasonable and appreciable.  The time scale allows the
	benefit of prediction and expectation, but the details must be flexible
	enough to meet unexpected outcomes or activities.

* *Beyond...*

	There are other scales beyond those that manage teams of teams.  There are
	several titles and roles, but the scale of planning is often in terms of
	years.  These stages exist deeply in the land of ambiguity.  The ability to
	concretely predict what's on the horizon has been lost.  Instead, there's a
	small bit of prognostication.  The strength of this role is to not only
	imagine the far future but also to develop the excitement and commitment
	across all levels of the organization to make it manifest.  In a real sense,
	these roles don't solve "today's problems," but rather must be thinking
	about the abstract "tomorrow problems" that can, may, and will arise.

These scales roughly map out to various levels of team leadership for
engineering managers.  The time periods are relatively obvious, but many do not
think about them abstractly.  When I speak to the managers that report to me,
they're often thinking too deeply about their needs and their team's immediate
needs.  Many ICs aren't thinking about time scales at all.

Being mindful of the scales and the need for comfort in ambiguity is a great way
to gauge whether someone is close to the next level of responsibility.  Not
everyone that is comfortable in ambiguity is ready for a promotion.  Not 
everyone that can confidently plan in an increasing scale of time is ready for
that next task.  That said, if someone is able to plan and execute
at a larger scale consistently, it's time for me to evaluate all of their 
leadership skills and have that communication of career expectations and growth.
